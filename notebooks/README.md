Excellent tutorials in https://mlc.ai/chapter_introduction/index.html

In this folder, the added notebooks are:
- 00_first_tests.ipynb : Defining a model with the relax frontend, generating TensorIR representation and executing the model.
- 01_play_with_passes.ipynb : Defining a simple Relax model, printing the Relax/TIR intermediate representation (IR) and showing how the transforms modify the IR. If needed, you can run the generated IR after lowering.
